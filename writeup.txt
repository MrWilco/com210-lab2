I start by asking the user to enter a delimiter (a string with parentheses pairs).  I take the string they enter and go through each character one at a time.  If the current character is an open parentheses ‘(‘  I add it to a stack.  If the character is a closed parentheses ‘)’ I remove an element from the stack.  So if the string has equal pairs of parentheses, the stack will end empty.  If the pairs aren’t fully complete, the stack will have open parentheses left over.  If so, the code will throw an error at the end.
